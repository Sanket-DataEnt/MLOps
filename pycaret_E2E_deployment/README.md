# Build with PyCaret, Deploy with FastAPI

## In this I will try to replicate the below tutorial by the creator of pycaret
[Deployment with FastAPI and Pycaret](https://bit.ly/3uqK9ge)

**Business Problem**

    For this tutorial, I will be using a very popular case study by Darden School of Business, published in [Harvard Business](https://hbsp.harvard.edu/product/UV0869-PDF-ENG). The case is regarding the story of two people who are going to be married in the future. The guy named Greg wanted to buy a ring to propose to a girl named Sarah. The problem is to find the ring Sarah will like, but after a suggestion from his close friend, Greg decides to buy a diamond stone instead so that Sarah can decide her choice. Greg then collects data of 6000 diamonds with their price and attributes like cut, color, shape, etc.

**Data**

    In this tutorial, I will be using a dataset from a very popular case study by the Darden School of Business, published in [Harvard Business](https://hbsp.harvard.edu/product/UV0869-PDF-ENG). The goal of this tutorial is to predict the diamond price based on its attributes like carat weight, cut, color, etc. You can download the dataset from [PyCaretâ€™s repository](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/tree/master/datasets).
